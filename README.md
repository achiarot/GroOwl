# GroOwl
Temperature dependent glowing statue
This is a 3d printed statue that will glow according to the temperature read from a DS18B20 temperature sensor.  There is a design
board and software for the control of the issue.  I have designed an eagle CAD board and also included a manual circuit for this
project. A 1W RGB LED is used and the driver board is meant for that.

(IN PROGRESS)
1. Build or have the board created(still in testing - Eagle file not tested).
2. Edit configuration section of the software to match your setup.
3. Uplaod to your Arduino mini 5V.
4. Plug into home made or PCB version of the board.
5. 3d Print a statue.  I have used an Owl off of thingiverse.
6 Print the base that I have included.
7. Glue it all together.
